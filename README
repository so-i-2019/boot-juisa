 OPERATING SYSTEMS CLASS PROJECT
 -------------------------------

 This repo contains the first project for our Operating Systems class, 
 in it you will find a bootloader that plays a guessing game with you,
 where you think of a natural number between 0 and 65000 and it guesses
 the number within 17 tries.
 
 WHAT YOU'LL NEED
 -------------
 
 You'll need a standard modern GNU/Linux platform with binutils, nasm,
 qemu, make and your preferred text editor.

 Edit 'Makefile' for configuration directions.

 BUILDING RULES
 --------------

 At the terminal prompt, command

    $ make

 builds your MBR image (boot loader binary).

 You may test it using the x86 emulator by issuing

    $ make test

 In order to build a bootable ISO image for a USB memory stick, issue

    $ make iso

 and to test it, use

    $ make test-iso

 To copy the iso image to your physical USB memory stick, use

    $ make stick

 Other rules such as clean etc. work as usual.

 TROUBLESHOOTING
 ---------------

 If you have problems booting your iso image through your USB stick, check
 your BIOS configuration settings, specially boot options. You may need to
 enable legacy BIOS support, or to disable security boot features.
