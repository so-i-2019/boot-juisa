# binary_search - bootloader

This repo contains the first project for our Operating Systems class, in it you will find a bootloader that plays a guessing game with you, where you think of a natural number between 0 and 65000 and it guesses the number within 17 tries.
The code was developed in Assembly x86 based on a [template](https://github.com/monacofj/asm-bootloader-template) provided by the teacher
